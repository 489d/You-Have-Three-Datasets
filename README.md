# You-Have-Three-Datasets
Longform data analysis article arguing every “dataset” is actually three: Observed (captured rows), Missing (what should exist but doesn’t), and Excluded (what filters/joins/dropna removed). Includes dataset accounting, join-loss and missingness audits, segmentation checks, and practical templates to prevent biased KPIs and wrong conclusions.
